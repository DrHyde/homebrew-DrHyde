A few [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) formulae. They're either:

* missing from [homebrew-core](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/) (for good reasons, mostly);
* have been removed from homebrew-core;
* or are out-of-date versions of stuff in homebrew-core that I need for various reasons

To use them `brew tap DrHyde/homebrew-DrHyde`.
